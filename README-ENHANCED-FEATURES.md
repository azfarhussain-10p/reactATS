const MyComponent = () => {
  const { 
    createSegment, 
    segments, 
    getSegmentCandidates 
  } = useTalentPoolSegmentation();
  
  // Create a new talent segment
  const handleCreateSegment = () => {
    createSegment({
      name: 'Senior JavaScript Developers',
      description: 'Candidates with 5+ years of JavaScript experience',
      criteria: [
        {
          id: '1',
          field: 'skills',
          operator: 'in',
          value: ['JavaScript', 'React', 'Node.js'],
          valueType: 'array'
        },
        {
          id: '2',
          field: 'experience',
          operator: 'greater_than',
          value: 5,
          valueType: 'number'
        }
      ],
      color: '#1976d2',
      isActive: true
    });
  };
  
  // Get candidates in a segment
  const getCandidates = (segmentId) => {
    const candidates = getSegmentCandidates(segmentId);
    // Do something with candidates...
  };
  
  // Rest of component...
};
```

### Cost-per-hire Analysis

```tsx
import { useAnalytics } from '../contexts/AnalyticsContext';

const CostAnalysisComponent = () => {
  const { getCostData } = useAnalytics();
  
  // Get cost data for a specific period
  const analyzeCosts = async () => {
    const period = '2023-Q4';
    const filters = [
      { field: 'department', operator: 'equals', value: 'Engineering' }
    ];
    
    const costData = await getCostData(period, filters);
    
    // Calculate cost per hire
    const totalCost = costData.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.amount, 0);
    const totalHires = 8; // Would come from another API call
    const costPerHire = totalCost / totalHires;
    
    // Do something with the cost per hire value...
  };
  
  // Rest of component...
};
```
