# Application Process

The Application Process feature manages the end-to-end workflow for job applications, from initial submission to candidate disposition.

## Overview

The application process in the ATS system provides:
- A structured workflow for tracking candidates through the hiring pipeline
- Tools for recruiters to manage and evaluate applications
- Status tracking and communication with candidates
- Integration with the interview process

## Pipeline Stages

Applications flow through the following stages:

1. **Applied** - Initial application received
2. **Screening** - Initial resume/application review
3. **Assessment** - Skills assessment or testing phase
4. **Interview** - Interview process (may have multiple rounds)
5. **Evaluation** - Post-interview evaluation and decision making
6. **Offer** - Job offer extended to candidate
7. **Hired** - Candidate accepts offer
8. **Rejected** - Candidate is rejected at any stage

## Implementation Details

### Components

The Application Process is implemented with the following components:

- **ApplicationList.tsx**: List view of all applications
- **ApplicationDetail.tsx**: Detailed view of a single application
- **ApplicationFilter.tsx**: Filtering options for applications
- **ApplicationStageChange.tsx**: UI for changing application stages
- **ApplicationStatusChange.tsx**: UI for changing application status
- **ApplicationNotes.tsx**: Interface for adding notes to applications
- **ApplicationForm.jsx**: Public-facing form for submitting applications

### Data Model

The Application object contains:

```typescript
interface Application {
  id: number;
  jobId: number;
  jobTitle: string;
  candidateId: number | null;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  resume: string;
  coverLetter: string;
  linkedInUrl: string;
  portfolioUrl: string;
  referredBy: string;
  source: string;
  answers: ApplicationAnswer[];
  status: ApplicationStatus;
  stage: ApplicationStage;
  appliedDate: string;
  stageHistory: StageHistoryEntry[];
  notes: string;
  flagged: boolean;
  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

### API Integration

The Application Process uses the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/applications` - Get all applications with filtering
- `GET /api/applications/:id` - Get a specific application
- `POST /api/applications` - Create a new application
- `PUT /api/applications/:id` - Update an application
- `PATCH /api/applications/:id/status` - Update application status
- `PATCH /api/applications/:id/stage` - Update application stage
- `DELETE /api/applications/:id` - Delete an application

## Workflow

### Candidate Perspective

1. Candidate views job listings on the Careers Page
2. Candidate selects a job and clicks "Apply"
3. Application form is displayed with required fields
4. Candidate completes and submits the form
5. Confirmation is displayed to the candidate
6. (Optional) Candidate receives email confirmation
7. Status updates are communicated to the candidate as appropriate

### Recruiter Perspective

1. New applications appear in the "Applied" stage
2. Recruiter reviews application details and resume
3. Recruiter moves the application to the appropriate next stage:
   - "Screening" for initial review
   - "Rejected" for unsuitable candidates
4. Applications progress through stages based on evaluation
5. Recruiter can add notes and feedback at any stage
6. Automated or manual emails can be sent to candidates
7. Final disposition is tracked in the system

## Configuration Options

### Customization

- Custom application form fields can be configured
- Email templates for candidate communication can be customized
- Stage names and workflow can be adapted to match company process
- Automated actions can be configured at various stages

### Integration Points

- Email service for candidate communication
- Calendar service for interview scheduling
- Document storage for resumes and attachments
- Analytics system for reporting

## Performance Considerations

- Application list uses pagination and lazy loading
- Resume previews are generated efficiently
- Search and filtering operations are optimized
- Bulk actions are available for processing multiple applications

## Security

- PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is properly secured
- Access to application data is restricted by role
- Resume storage follows security best practices
- External application submissions use CSRF protection

## Accessibility

- Application form meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Keyboard navigation is fully supported
- Screen reader compatibility is maintained
- Error messages are clear and helpful

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application submission errors**
   - Check for required fields validation
   - Verify file upload size limits for resumes
   - Check connectivity to the API server

2. **Missing application data**
   - Verify that all required fields are populated
   - Check for data migration issues
   - Ensure API responses are complete

3. **Stage transition problems**
   - Check user permissions for stage changes
   - Verify workflow configuration
   - Check for required fields at each stage
