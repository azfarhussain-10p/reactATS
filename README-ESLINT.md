# ESLint Configuration Guide

## Overview

This project uses ESLint to maintain code quality and enforce consistent coding standards. However, due to the current state of the codebase, a number of ESLint and TypeScript errors exist that would normally prevent the build from completing.

## Current Configuration

To allow development to proceed while these issues are being addressed, we've made the following adjustments:

1. Created a `.eslintrc.json` file that temporarily disables problematic rules
2. Modified `tsconfig.app.json` to be more permissive during development
3. Updated build scripts to allow the application to build despite TypeScript errors
4. Configured git hooks with Husky to automatically format and lint code before commits

## Scripts

The following npm scripts are available for linting:

- `npm run lint:check` - Run ESLint and display all issues without failing
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run our custom fix script to fix autofixable ESLint issues
- `npm run lint` - Run standard ESLint check
- `npm run build` - Build the application without TypeScript checks
- `npm run build:with-ts` - Build with TypeScript checking enabled (will fail until issues are fixed)
- `npm run format` - Run Prettier to format all code

## Git Hooks

This project uses Husky to run pre-commit hooks that automatically:

1. Format staged files with Prettier before committing
2. Fix autofixable ESLint issues
3. Add the fixed files back to the staging area

This ensures that all committed code maintains a consistent style and avoids common ESLint errors.

## Common ESLint Issues

The main types of issues in the codebase are:

1. **Unused Imports and Variables**

   - Remove imports you're not using
   - Remove variables that are declared but never referenced

2. **TypeScript `any` Type Usage**

   - Replace with appropriate TypeScript types
   - Use interfaces or type aliases for complex types

3. **React Hooks Dependencies**

   - Add missing dependencies to useEffect/useCallback dependency arrays
   - Use useRef for values that shouldn't trigger re-renders

4. **Fast Refresh Issues**

   - Move non-component utility functions to separate files
   - Keep component files focused on just the component

5. **Lexical Declarations in Case Blocks**

   - Move variable declarations outside the case block
   - Or wrap the case block in curly braces

6. **Material UI Grid Issues**
   - The `Grid` component requires a `component` prop, or needs to be updated to a newer version of Material UI

## Properly Fixing the Issues

When you're ready to properly address these issues:

1. Enable strict TypeScript checking in `tsconfig.app.json`
2. Remove `.eslintrc.json` to restore the default ESLint configuration
3. Run `npm run lint` to see all issues
4. Fix each issue according to the guidelines above
5. Use `npm run build:with-ts` to verify a clean build
